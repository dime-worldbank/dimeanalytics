# DIME Analytics - priorities voting

This repository was created for all of you to be able to vote on what new features, tools, guidelines or other tasks you want us to spend time on in the near future. You can also suggest new items you think we should prioritize.

## How to see what tasks can be voted on

You can see a list of all the tasks in our wishlist [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dimeanalytics/issues). Click on an issue to see a more detailed description of the new task. When you do that, you can see any other comments made in relation to the progress of that task. Scroll down to add more comments. We would love to know your thoughts or get new resources resources or get any other contribution you may have.

## How to see what is already in progress

Click [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dimeanalytics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22work-in-progress%22). Tasks already in progress are marked with a `work-in-progress` label.

## How to see which task has the most votes now

Click [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dimeanalytics/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Avote+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to see the wishlist sorted on decreasing order of "_thumbs-up_" (:+1:) received. While this is the sort order that matters to our prioritization, you can sort the tasks in different ways using the sort button. See the blue circle below:
