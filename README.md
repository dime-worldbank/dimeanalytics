# DIME Analytics - priorities voting

This repository is mainly for all of you to be able to vote on what new features, tools, guidelines or other tasks you want us to spend time on in the near future. You can also suggest new things we should prioritize.

## How to see what tasks already in the pipeline

You can see a list of all the task [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dimeanalytics/issues). You can click on any of the issue to see a more detailed description of the new tasks by clicking any of them. When you click on them you can see any other comments someone have made in relation to the progress of that task. If you scroll down you are also very welcomed to add details or resources or anything else relevant to the new feature.

## How to see which task has the most votes now

You can click [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dimeanalytics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to see the lists of all tasks but this time it will be sorted in the order of how many "_thumbs-up_" (:+1:) that the task has received. While this is the sort order that matters to our prioritization, you can sort the tasks in different ways using the sort button. See the blue circle below:
