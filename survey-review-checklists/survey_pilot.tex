		\section*{Objective}
		Project teams will submit a \href{https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/px74eyztrn7uv1hsbeoz3/Survey-Pilot-Plan-Template-for-teams.paper?dl=0&rlkey=yaid3m17zzzjpfoconj0zw6fu}{\textcolor{blue}{Survey Pilot Plan Template (for teams)}} and a Pilot timeline GANTT chart. The objective of the review is to ensure that the pilot is set up in such  that teams are able to maximize learning from the pilot. \\





\section*{Main findings}

This report details the findings from review of the survey pilot for the \textit{Survey Round}  of the \textit{Project name} project.

\subsection*{Required practices}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{List required practices identified for project}
\end{itemize} 
\subsection*{Recommended practices}

The \href{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Ietestform}{ietestform} command (from the iefieldkit package) was run and the results are attached. It is a good practice to run iestestform multiple times during survey development. This is to make sure you’ve incorporated all suggested changes that are relevant and to re-test when new questions are added during the development phase of the survey.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{List recommended practices identified for project}
\end{itemize}

The checklist in the next section details the exact findings.
