		\section{Objective}
		Project teams will submit the paper survey along with a pre-analysis plan/i2i table/concept note. The objective of the review is to ensure that the survey designed is collecting all required information in a manner conducive to the respondents.

	\section*{Main findings}

This report details the findings from review of the paper survey designed for the \textit{Survey Round}  of the \textit{Project name} project.

\subsection*{Required practices}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{List required practices identified for project}
\end{itemize} 
\subsection*{Recommended practices}

The \href{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Ietestform}{ietestform} command (from the iefieldkit package) was run and the results are attached. It is a good practice to run iestestform multiple times during survey development. This is to make sure you’ve incorporated all suggested changes that are relevant and to re-test when new questions are added during the development phase of the survey.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{List recommended practices identified for project}
\end{itemize}

The checklist in the next section details the exact findings.
