# Guide to requesting cloud resources

## Intro - Please read

DIME Analytics will help you request the cloud resources that you need.
Unfortunately requesting cloud sources is a very manual process that
will require you and your team to provide answer to a lot of questions.
Here is some background that is important to understand before going into this process.

Cloud resources paid for by WB funding must be created by the **ITS** unit (WB's IT Services unit).
If you create your own AWS account and create resources you simply will not be reimbursed.
WB ITS will not create anything unless WB **OIS** (WB's Office of Information Security unit).
OIS will have many questions that you and your team will have to answer.
DIME Analytics will support your team in answering these questions,
but will not be able to answer these questions for you.

OIS and ITS will look primarily at the requirements you need for your cloud service.
They will take into account if you have a specific preference,
but the requirement will always be more important to them.
For example, you can say
"_I would need a server with 32GB RAM (for example AWS EC2) and storage for 200GB data (for example AWS S3)_".
But it will not be sufficient to say "_I want an EC2 server and a S3 bucket_".
It is perfectly fine to not know the name of the product you want,
and you can say "I would need a server with 32GB RAM and storage for 200GB data".
